    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div class="columns">
      <div>
        <h3>Global</h3>
        <p>Around the world, urbanization has become both a sign of progress and a source of struggle. Cities drive economies and connect people to opportunity, but they also face issues like overcrowding, pollution, housing shortages, and weak transportation systems. When planning can’t keep up, the result is inequality and environmental decline — where progress benefits some, but burdens many. SDG 11 challenges nations to rethink what it means to build a “successful” city — one that’s not only advanced, but also livable and fair.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Local (Philippines)</h3>
        <p>In the Philippines, urbanization often feels like running ahead of yourself — fast, full of hope, but not always steady. Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao have become centers of business and culture, yet they also face traffic jams, housing shortages, flooding, and pollution. Informal settlements continue to grow as families move to cities for work, while the lack of long-term planning makes basic services harder to sustain. Our cities hold promise, but to make them sustainable, progress needs to reach beyond the skyline.</p>

    <h2>Causes</h2>
    <div class="columns">
      <div>
        <h3>Global</h3>
        <p>Industrial growth, increasing population, and migration to cities have caused rapid urban expansion that outpaces planning and resources.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Local (Philippines)</h3>
        <p>Weak urban planning, limited housing programs, and poor transportation systems worsen congestion and overcrowding in Philippine cities.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

  <section id="effects" class="content">
    <h2>Effects</h2>
    <div class="columns">
      <div>
        <h3>Global</h3>
        <p>Unsustainable cities lead to climate change, poor air quality, and growing inequality between rich and poor communities.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Local (Philippines)</h3>
        <p>Heavy traffic, flooding, and air pollution have become major problems in urban areas like Metro Manila, threatening health and productivity.</p>

  <section id="actions" class="content">
    <h2>Current Actions</h2>
    <div class="columns">
      <div>
        <h3>Global</h3>
        <p>Organizations like UN-Habitat promote sustainable housing, renewable energy, and green transport in growing cities worldwide.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Local (Philippines)</h3>
        <p>The government and local groups have launched initiatives such as the Pasig River rehabilitation, waste segregation drives, and eco-friendly transport programs.</p>
      </div>

  <section id="solutions" class="content">
    <h2>Possible Solutions</h2>
    <div class="columns">
      <div>
        <h3>Global</h3>
        <p> To make cities around the world truly sustainable, the focus must shift from profit to people. Governments should prioritize renewable energy, affordable housing, and accessible public transport that reduces pollution and congestion. Citizens, in turn, can embrace greener lifestyles, join community-driven projects, and demand accountability from leaders. Through shared responsibility and long-term planning, SDG 11 can evolve from a vision to a reality—where cities become inclusive, resilient, and built to last.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Local (Philippines)</h3>
        <p>For the Philippines, achieving sustainable cities means addressing the challenges that hit closest to home—flooding, waste, and rapid urban growth. The government can strengthen flood control systems, promote renewable energy, and ensure safe, affordable housing in hazard-free zones. Meanwhile, citizens can take part in proper waste management, tree planting, and local cleanups to nurture both city and sea. When governance and community meet halfway, the dream of livable, resilient Philippine cities moves closer to truth.</p>
